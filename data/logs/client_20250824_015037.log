=== Iteration 1/5 ===
Making API call with model: gpt-4o-mini, temperature: 1.0, max_tokens: 1000
Full response: [Calling tool complete_network_gw_matched_filter_search with args {'gps_start': 1126259446, 'gps_end': 1126259478, 'detectors': ['H1', 'L1'], 'mass1': 16, 'mass2': 9, 'ra': 0.95, 'dec': -0.27}]
### Iteration 1 Results:
- **Max Network SNR:** 6.28
- **Max SNR Time:** 1126259462.45
- **Mass1:** 16.0 solar masses
- **Mass2:** 9.0 solar masses
- **Right Ascension (RA):** 0.95 radians
- **Declination (Dec):** -0.27 radians

#### Reflection:
The initial parameters yielded a maximum SNR of 6.28, but the detection significance was still below the threshold for significance (2.17). The contributions from the detectors were relatively balanced but suggest that tuning the values might provide better results.

The antenna pattern responses are useful:
- **H1 (fp):** -0.37, **(fc):** 0.43
- **L1 (fp):** 0.62, **(fc):** -0.40

### Based on these findings, adjustments in the parameters can be made:
1. **Mass1** and **Mass2** can be slightly varied (±5 solar masses) since the SNR might benefit from being more closely aligned with expected compact object binaries.
2. **GA changes in RA** and **Dec** may enhance contributions from the detectors based on SNR data.

### Plan for Iteration 2:
Adjust mass parameters slightly while keeping the sky location centered around initial values:
- **Mass1:** 18
- **Mass2:** 8
- **RA:** 0.96 (slightly adjusted)
- **Dec:** -0.25 (slightly adjusted)

Let's perform the next search.

=== Iteration 2/5 ===
Making API call with model: gpt-4o-mini, temperature: 1.0, max_tokens: 1000
Full response: To optimize the gravitational wave matched filter search, we can refine the parameters (mass1, mass2, ra, dec) based on the previous results. Since this is the second iteration, we can make slight adjustments to the parameters to increase the network signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

### Previous Results Summary
- **Mass1:** Optimize around previous estimates for mass1.
- **Mass2:** Optimize around previous estimates for mass2.
- **Right Ascension (ra):** Adjust based on sky localization information.
- **Declination (dec):** Adjust based on previous declination values.

### Proposed Parameter Adjustments
- **Mass1:** Increase by a small percentage (e.g., 2%).
- **Mass2:** Decrease by a small percentage (e.g., 2%).
- **Right Ascension:** Adjust slightly based on uncertainty (e.g., +/- 0.01 radians).
- **Declination:** Adjust slightly based on uncertainty (e.g., +/- 0.01 radians).

Now we need to define new values for mass1, mass2, ra, and dec. If you have specific values from the previous results, please provide them so we can make precise adjustments. If not, I can generate some initial values based on typical binary black hole ranges.

Please confirm or provide the previous parameter values if available.

=== Iteration 3/5 ===
Making API call with model: gpt-4o-mini, temperature: 1.0, max_tokens: 1000
Full response: [Calling tool complete_network_gw_matched_filter_search with args {'mass1': 34, 'mass2': 29, 'ra': 1.5, 'dec': -0.5}]
In this third iteration of optimizing the matched filter search for gravitational waves, we explored a set of parameters resulting in a maximum network Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of approximately 16.57, which is a significant improvement. Here are the details and recommendations based on the current results:

### Current Results
- **Mass 1**: 34.0 solar masses
- **Mass 2**: 29.0 solar masses
- **Right Ascension (RA)**: 1.5 radians (approximately 85.94 degrees)
- **Declination (Dec)**: -0.5 radians (approximately -28.65 degrees)
- **Maximum Network SNR**: 16.57
- **Detection Significance**: 6.92 (indicating a statistically significant detection)
- **Detector Contributions**:
  - **H1**: SNR = 15.98
  - **L1**: SNR = 4.41

### Observations
- The current mass parameters (34 and 29 solar masses) yield a high detection significance. 
- There is a reasonable contribution from both detectors, although H1 provides significantly more SNR than L1.

### Recommendations for Further Optimization
1. **Parameter Exploration**: 
   - Adjust both masses slightly. Since we are near an optimal region, exploring around the current values (e.g., mass1 in [32, 36] that incrementally changes and mass2 in [27, 31]) may solidify gains.
  
2. **Change of RA and Dec**: 
   - Since RA and Dec are crucial for sky localization, considering small increments should allow identifying any potential sweet spots for improved SNR. For example, adjusting RA by ±0.1 radians and Dec by ±0.1 radians to examine new configurations.

3. **Summary of Next Steps**: 
   - Propose a set of trials using the modified mass ranges, along with slight variations in RA and Dec. This exploration strategy should be systematic, allowing for a comprehensive evaluation of each parameter's impact on the resulting SNR.

### Next Parameter Selection Strategy
Based on the current findings:
- Explore mass1 at values: 32.0, 33.0, 34.0, 35.0, 36.0
- Explore mass2 at values: 27.0, 28.0, 29.0, 30.0, 31.0
- Explore RA at values: 1.4, 1.5, 1.6 radians
- Explore Dec at values: -0.6, -0.5, -0.4 radians

Let’s proceed with iterations using these refined parameter sets to maximize network SNR further.

=== Iteration 4/5 ===
Making API call with model: gpt-4o-mini, temperature: 1.0, max_tokens: 1000
Full response: In order to optimize the gravitational wave matched filter search effectively, I will refer to the previous results to make a more informed decision on the parameters for mass1, mass2, ra, and dec. Typically, the strategy would involve exploring the vicinity of previously tested values that yielded high SNR.

To make these updates, I need some information from the previous results:
- The values of mass1 and mass2 that were they tested previously.
- The right ascension (ra) and declination (dec) values that were explored.
- The corresponding SNR values for those parameters.

If you provide the last set of parameters and their respective SNR results, I can suggest refined values and initiate a new search iteration based on that information.

=== Iteration 5/5 ===
Making API call with model: gpt-4o-mini, temperature: 1.0, max_tokens: 1000
Full response: To continue optimizing the gravitational wave matched filter search for the 5th iteration, we can refine the parameters based on the previous results. Since I don't have access to specific values from the previous iterations, I'll need to make some typical adjustments based on common optimization strategies.

### Proposed Parameter Adjustments
1. **Masses:** Small adjustments can be made to `mass1` and `mass2`. For example, if previous values were close to 30 and 25 solar masses, we can try:
   - `mass1`: Adjust by ±1 or ±2 solar masses.
   - `mass2`: Adjust by ±1 or ±2 solar masses.
   
2. **Sky Location (ra, dec):**
   - Adjust `ra` slightly (±0.01 radians).
   - Adjust `dec` slightly (±0.01 radians).

Assuming I have the following previous values:
- **mass1**: 30
- **mass2**: 25
- **ra**: 2.5
- **dec**: -0.5

I will propose new values:
- **mass1**: 31
- **mass2**: 26
- **ra**: 2.51
- **dec**: -0.49

### Pipeline Setup
Next, I will set up the complete network gravitational wave matched filter search with the new parameter values. 

Please confirm or provide any specific values you want to adjust, and I will proceed to execute the matched filtering search.
